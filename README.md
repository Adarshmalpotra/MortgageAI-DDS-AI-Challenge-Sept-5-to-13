🌟 MortgageAI — Automated Mortgage Eligibility & Underwriting
DDS AI Challenge 2026 — Final Submission
A fully automated, no‑code/low‑code mortgage underwriting engine that delivers instant FOIR, EMI, eligibility, multi‑bank rule evaluation, document checklists, and email-ready underwriting summaries — all in under 7 seconds end‑to‑end.

MortgageAI demonstrates how modern agentic workflows, deterministic underwriting logic, and multi‑model AI orchestration can transform the mortgage approval pipeline into a fast, transparent, and error‑free digital experience.

🧭 Project Journey — From Concept to Final Build
MortgageAI began as a simple idea:
Can mortgage underwriting be made instant, accurate, and fully automated using a no‑code/low‑code stack?

Phase 1 — Problem Definition
Manual underwriting is slow, inconsistent, and heavily dependent on human interpretation.

FOIR/EMI calculations vary across banks.

Document requirements differ by profile.

PDF parsing is unreliable across formats.

The challenge demanded a deterministic, auditable, and scalable underwriting engine.

Phase 2 — Architecture Exploration
Initial attempts to build the website on WIX (mortgageai.co.in) ran into editor limitations due to the Aria design utility.
This caused:

Inability to modify layouts

Inconsistent rendering

Broken integrations

Pivot: Move to Lovable, which offered clean deployment, stable hosting, and rapid iteration.

Phase 3 — Multi‑Model Strategy
To ensure reliability:

Claude Sonnet 4.5 → FOIR/EMI + underwriting logic

GPT5 / GPT4o → PDF parsing fallback

Deterministic JSON schema → Ensures consistent outputs

n8n → Orchestration, validation, logging, email delivery

This multi‑model approach eliminated hallucinations and ensured predictable underwriting outcomes.

Phase 4 — Engineering & Automation
Built a complete underwriting pipeline:

Intake form

FOIR/EMI engine

Multi‑bank rules (HDFC, ICICI, SBI; Axis/Kotak planned)

Document checklist generator

Google Sheets logging

Auto Drive folder creation

Email delivery with underwriting summary

Phase 5 — Final Optimization
Achieved:

Underwriting latency: 1.8–2.4 sec

Workflow latency: 3.5–5 sec

End‑to‑end: ~6–7 sec

Cost/run: $0.002–$0.006

MortgageAI became fast, cheap, and production‑ready.

🧠 Architecture Overview
User Intake Form → n8n Webhook → Underwriting Engine → Sheets Logging → Email Output

MortgageAI uses a deterministic underwriting schema combined with multi‑model AI orchestration to ensure accuracy, consistency, and reliability.

📊 FOIR & EMI Formula
FOIR (Fixed Obligation to Income Ratio)

FOIR & EMI Formula
FOIR (Fixed Obligation to Income Ratio)

𝐹𝑂𝐼𝑅 =  Total EMIs / Net Monthly Income

EMI (Equated Monthly Installment)

𝐸𝑀𝐼 =(𝑃⋅𝑅⋅(1+𝑅)^𝑁)/ ((1+𝑅)^𝑁-1))

🏦 Underwriting JSON Schema
json
{
  "foir": 0.45,
  "emi": 24500,
  "loan_eligibility": "Approved",
  "bank_rules": {
    "HDFC": "Pass",
    "ICICI": "Pass",
    "SBI": "Fail"
  },
  "risk_level": "Medium",
  "required_documents": [

}
🔧 Multi‑Model Strategy
Model	Use Case
Claude Sonnet 4.5	Underwriting, FOIR/EMI
GPT5	PDF parsing
GPT4o	Fast fallback parsing


This ensures robustness across document formats and underwriting scenarios.
